I.	USE CASE 
##############

When using WEBPACK together with GULP we only use parts of the webpack capabilities. Webpack makes it a lot easier to manage dependencies, especially for more complex projects. 

In the this configuration webpack is only used as a transpiler and bundler for JS files using the BABEL loader.

IMPORTANT: setup webpack LOCALLY only to avoid conflicts! You already learned the hard way.

	npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli	
		// required for >v4.0
	
	package.json		// Scripts: "webpack": "webpack"

	npm run webpack		// run in the CLI project dir

Configure the webpack.config.js in the PROJECT root folder: see documentation for details.

II.	FILE AND FOLDER STRUCTURE 
###############################

BUNDLING JS MODULES

In a NodeJs environment a JS file that has a variable grasping a require('') statement will be located at the referenced module and IMPORT it's EXPORTED module: module.exports

OUTPUT FILES

You can use a TEMP(dev) folder where the compiled js file is located together with the temporary index.html and main.css files, or let all files live next to each other as long as you don't confuse the file you develop your code into versus the file that is bundled by webpack and used in the html.

In webpack.config.js: 
  
	output: {
    		path: path.resolve(__dirname, './app/temp'),
    		filename: '[name]-bundle.js' 

EXTERNAL PACKAGES

You can require() other partial _js files OR NPM packages such as jQuery or Lodash.

	npm install jquery --save 
	npm install --save lodash 	
	
		// will be bundled into final code! 

	const $ = require('jQuery');

	$('h1')remove();			// removes all h1 on the page

NOTE: The idea of using external packages that are intertwined with your code goes against the webpack philosophy of creating seperate modules for each functionality. 

See https://webpack.js.org/guides/shimming/

It is better to manage to packages seperately and bundle into a vendor.bundle.js with seperate vendor.js ENTRY POINT.


#######################
III.	GULP TASK: BUNDLE
#######################

To use Webpack as a JS Bundler create a GULP TASK. 

A function jsCompile(cb), that takes a callback function to report to Gulp when the task is done running.

Inside the function you run just one method: webpack()

	require('webpack');
	
	const webpackConfig = require('webpack.config.js');
	
	function jsCompile(cb){
		webpack(webpackConfig, (err, stats)=>{
		if(err){log};
		log(stats); 
		cb();})
	}

IV.	CONFIGURE WEBPACK: BABEL LOADER
#####################################

This is preferable to setting up GULP with BABEL manually because webpack makes it easier to automatically track and transpile imports.

See documentation for install instructions: 

	https://github.com/babel/babel-loader

You need three components: 

babel-loader @babel/core @babel/preset-env

Next, set the webpack.config.js MODULE - RULES
