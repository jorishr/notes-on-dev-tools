NODEJS NODEMON MODULE
#####################

NODEMON can run as an npm script that executes your JS file and watches continously for updates. You can use it in combination with BABEL to auto-transpile ES2015 JS code, since some features are not supported by NODEJS (import).

	npm install nodemon --save-dev

In package.json add NPM script

"scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon --exec babel-node src/index.js",

Requires babel-node to be installed.
