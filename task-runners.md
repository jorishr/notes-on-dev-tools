# Task runners
Gulp and Grunt are both taskrunners. Use Gulp as task runner/build tool and complement with WebPack if necessary. 

WebPack was conceived as a module bundler. It takes all files (SASS files, LESS files, JavaScript files with modules and dependencies, images, etc.) that are connected in some way and bundles them into standard single Javascript, CSS, PNG and JPG files.

If you come from Gulp or Grunt Webpack basically does the same things: it takes your files, runs them through some sort of conversion/transpiler system and spits out something the browser can understand.
